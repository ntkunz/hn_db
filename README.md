Welcome to the Helping Neighbors database repository.

I am currently working out sanitization for prevention of sql injection on front and back ends before deployment.

This is here for you to be able to create a local database and run the Helping Neighbors app locally on your machine. 

Please refer to the front end repository for all installation instructions.
